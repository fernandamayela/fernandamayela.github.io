The Racial Turnout Gap in the 21st Century<br>

The Brennan Center is working to identify the causes of the growing racial turnout gap and to promote steps to remedy it. At a two-day symposium on March 11 and 12 at NYU, the nation’s leading social scientists will present research exploring these issues. Topics will include the effects of statewide voting policies, the barriers different minority groups face to voting, and myriad other obstacles hindering the exercise of the most vital of American rights.
