When democratic offcials communicate in a particular language, they implicitly include some constituents and exclude others. Very little research has identified what factors shape or constrain this decision. We propose a simple framework called “linguistic responsiveness”, which asks how closely the languages used by democratic offcials match the languages of their constituents. Perfect linguistic responsiveness may not be feasible, but how large a gap should we expect? Departures from linguistic responsiveness may be systematically related to important political processes, with potential implications for representation and participation. We illustrate the empirical study of linguistic responsiveness by classifying the languages available across the online platforms of 672 U.S. jurisdictions. We find substantial variation with no simple explanation. The well-established impact of information ecosystems on political outcomes suggests a pressing need to understand when and why offcials are linguistically responsive.
