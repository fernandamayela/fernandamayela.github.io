Hi, welcome to my website! My name is Fernanda Gonzalez, I am a senior at Wellesley College majoring in political science with a minor in computer science. My research focuses on the impact of linguistic accessibility on political engagement, specifically by analyzing the availability of online multilingual election-related information for individuals facing language barriers. 

Driven by a personal commitment to address the challenges faced by my home state, Texas, I am committed to addressing language accessibility as a significant barrier to political participation, particularly for non-native-English voters who often lack tailored election materials and are frequently overlooked, making Texas a state I am proud to call home.

I aim to delve deeper into political science, specifically focusing on researching and understanding the success factors influencing progressive Latino/a/xs in local state politics. My goal is not only to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world impact but also to champion a more inclusive and representative political landscape, starting from the foundations of our state government.
