Hi! My name is Fernanda, I'm a senior at Wellesley College majoring in political science with a minor in computer science. As an undergraduate, I have dedicated the past three years to conducting research with MIT's Election Data & Science Lab (MEDSL). My research focuses on the impact of linguistic accessibility on political engagement, specifically by analyzing the availability of online multilingual election-related information for individuals facing language barriers. 

Research Interests
======
My research interests focus on Latinx voter turnout and the factors influencing the success of progressive minority candidates in local state politics.

Driven by a personal commitment to address the challenges faced by my home state, Texas, I am committed to addressing language accessibility as a significant barrier to political participation, particularly for non-native-English voters who often lack tailored election materials and are frequently overlooked, making Texas a state I am proud to call home.

I aim to delve deeper into political science, specifically focusing on researching and understanding the success factors influencing progressive Latino/a/xs in local state politics. My goal is not only to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world impact but also to champion a more inclusive and representative political landscape, starting from the foundations of our state government.
