Hi! My name is Fernanda, I'm a senior at Wellesley College majoring in political science with a minor in computer science. As an undergraduate, I have dedicated the past two years to conducting research with MIT's Election Data & Science Lab (MEDSL). My research focuses on the impact of linguistic accessibility on political engagement, specifically by analyzing the availability of online multilingual election-related information for individuals facing language barriers. As a Mexican-American from Texas, I am motivated by firsthand experiences to bring about positive political change and representation for marginalized communities at the state and local levels. My research interests focus on Latinx voter turnout and the factors influencing the success of progressive minority candidates in local state politics. I am committed to addressing language accessibility as a significant barrier to political participation, particularly for non-native-English voters who often lack tailored election materials and are frequently overlooked. I believe that genuine and impactful change starts at the grassroots level and aim to connect my research to meaningful advancements in political representation.
