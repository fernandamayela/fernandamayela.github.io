My name is Fernanda, I'm a senior at Wellesley College majoring in political science with a minor in computer science. As an undergraduate, I have dedicated the past three years to conducting research with MIT's Election Data & Science Lab <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/" style="color: #F58FC0;">(MEDSL)</a>. My research focuses on the impact of linguistic accessibility on political engagement, specifically by analyzing the availability of online multilingual election-related information for individuals facing language barriers. 

I am originally from Austin, Texas and enjoy reading, cross-stitching, traveling, music, and spending time with my dachshunds

Research Interests
======

My research interests focus on Latinx voter turnout and the factors influencing the success of progressive minority candidates in local state politics.

Driven by a personal commitment to address the challenges faced by my home state, Texas, I am passionate about local state politics. As a Mexican-American from Texas, I have witnessed firsthand how Texas politicians often work against the rights of minorities, women, and marginalized communities, including immigrants, people of color, and individuals in the LGBTQ+ communities. Recognizing the need for substantial change, I am committed to addressing language accessibility as a significant barrier to political participation, particularly for non-native-English voters who often lack tailored election materials and are frequently overlooked, making Texas a state I am proud to call home.

This commitment is not merely an academic pursuit; it is rooted in the profound understanding that meaningful change begins within our communities. Despite numerous attempts to transform Texas, efforts often target higher offices, overlooking the pivotal role of local state congress and the state senate. I believe that genuine and impactful change starts at the grassroots level and aim to connect my research to meaningful advancements in political representation.

I aim to delve deeper into political science, specifically focusing on researching and understanding the success factors influencing progressive Latino/a/xs in local state politics. My goal is not only to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world impact but also to champion a more inclusive and representative political landscape, starting from the foundations of our state government.
